Located in the heart of Lahore, neighboring the buzzing Anarkali Bazar and the Mall Road, PUCIT is the largest institution of higher learning in Pakistan in Computer Science, Information Technology, and Software Engineering. The College took a modest start with the Center for Computer Science, established in the Center for Solid State Physics, Quaid-e-Azam (New) Campus, Lahore, in 1988. <br> The first degree program offered by the Center was a one-year Post Graduate Diploma (PGD) in Computer Science. 24 students were registered in this program during the first year. The Center was upgraded to Department of Computer Science in 1991. The Department started 2-year (4-semesters) PGD leading to MSc in Computer Science under the annual system. In its first batch, the 15 students were admitted to this program. The number doubled the following year. <br>

The Vice Chancellor, Lt Gen (R) Arshad Mahmood, further upgraded the Department to a constituent College in November 2000. The college was named Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT). The College launched the 4-year (8-semester) BSc (Honors) in Compute Science program in November 2000. The classes of the new BSc (Hons) in Computer Science started in January 2001 with about 180 students. The program was offered on Self-Support basis only. </p>
